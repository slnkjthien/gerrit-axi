/**
 * Posting one change-level message to one change.
 *
 * This is the third write, and the only module in the codebase that spells the
 * remote command it uses. That command can also vote, submit, abandon, restore
 * and rebase, which is why every other module is forbidden to name it
 * (test/layering.test.js scans for it) and why this one builds its argv in a
 * single function with no parameter for a flag: `buildMessageArgs` takes a
 * connection, a change, a patch set and a text, and emits a fixed shape whose
 * only option is `--message`. Nothing a caller passes can become an option,
 * because the text travels as one quoted word. test/vote-ban.test.js drives the
 * whole path and pins what leaves the process.
 *
 * Why a message at all: a squash publishes a pipeline's fixes as one patch set
 * carrying the original commit message, so nothing on the change says what the
 * pipeline changed. A change message is where that account belongs, and Gerrit
 * records one with no label when no label flag is given.
 *
 * The message is never an element of this process's argv -- the agent tier reads
 * it from stdin or a file -- but it is a word of ssh's remote command line, which
 * Gerrit's sshd tokenises itself with shell-like quoting. `quoteForGerrit` wraps
 * it in single quotes with the `'\''` idiom, which both Gerrit's tokeniser and a
 * POSIX shell read as one literal word. So even if the host resolved off a git
 * remote turns out to be an ordinary sshd, the text cannot become a command.
