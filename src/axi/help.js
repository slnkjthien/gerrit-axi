export const USAGE = `gerrit-axi - Gerrit for agents: your dashboard, review state as records, publish, message, and submit

usage: gerrit-axi [<command>] [options]
       gerrit-axi <command> --help     that command's options and examples

With no command it prints your dashboard: the changes awaiting your attention,
your work in progress, your outgoing reviews, the reviews you were asked for and
the changes you are CCed on, grouped as Gerrit's own dashboard groups them, with
a count per section and the next step to run.

Records go to stdout: TOON by default, strict JSON with --json. A failure writes
a typed error record to stdout in that same format, with ok: false, writes
nothing to stderr, and exits non-zero, so a caller reads one stream and the
exit code says what it holds. An option a command does not take is refused
before anything is asked of git or the server (exit 2), and the record's remedy
lists the options that command does take, naming the nearest when a misspelling
is close.

A record ends with help[] -- the next steps, as complete commands carrying this
call's --host and its siblings -- only where the next step is not obvious: after
a list, after publish, submit or message, and whenever something was held back.
A detail view or a confirmation carries none. A failure's help[] is the command
that fixes or diagnoses it, when there is one.

commands, and the options each one takes:
  dashboard                   the home view above, by name
      --rows <n>              rows shown per section (default 10, max 100)
  status                      changes awaiting your attention ("your turn")
  status mine                 your open changes
  status <change>...          specific change numbers
  status --query '<query>'    an arbitrary Gerrit query
      --limit <n>             maximum changes to fetch (default 100)
  show <change>...            full review state, one record per change
      --messages <n|all>      also emit that many cover messages (default 0)
      --comments              also emit the inline comments
      --bots | --humans       with --comments: only / never machine-generated
      --full                  whole message and comment bodies; without it a
                              body over 1000 characters is cut to its first
                              1000, its row says chars (the total) and
                              truncated: true, and help[] names this option
  comments <change>...        inline review comments on every change named
      --bots | --humans       only / never machine-generated
      --full                  whole comment bodies, as for show
  auth status                 whether the stored credential still works
  publish --stack --topic <t> every commit on HEAD since it left the server's
                              branch becomes its own change, under topic <t>
  publish --squash            those commits become one change
      --branch <b>            the branch to propose against (default: the
                              server's default branch)
  submit <change>             ask the server to submit one change; a refusal is
                              reported in the server's own words
  message <change>            post one change-level message on the change's
                              current patch set; the text is read from stdin
      --file <path>           ...or from this file. Never from argv. No label,
                              no vote: the record names the patch set it landed on

global options:
  --json          strict JSON instead of TOON
  --host <h>      override the resolved Gerrit host
  --user <u>      override the resolved Gerrit username
  --port <p>      override the Gerrit SSH port
  --project <p>   override the resolved project
  --rest-base <u> override the REST base URL (e.g. https://gerrit.example.com)
  -h, --help      show this help; after a command, only that command's help
  -v, -V, --version
                  print the bare version

Every read answers about a whole list of changes in one invocation. Per-change
scalars arrive in the 'changes' table; anything per-label arrives in 'labels' and
'votes', keyed by change number and label name, so a label the server gains adds
a row and moves no column.

Host, port, user and project are resolved from the 'origin' git remote of the
current directory first, then from GERRIT_HOST / GERRIT_USER / GERRIT_PORT, then
from the config file. There is no built-in default host.

Exit codes: 0 success, 1 other error, 2 usage, 3 configuration, 4 authentication,
5 transport.

publish keeps every Change-Id a commit already carries, verbatim: the same
Change-Id is what makes a push a new patch set of the same change. A commit
without one gets one stamped into its message, and the local branch is rewritten
to keep it (messages only; the working tree is untouched).

It publishes, posts a change message, and submits, and it cannot vote: no command
records a label, and whether a change may be submitted is decided by the server
alone.`;

  dashboard: `gerrit-axi dashboard - your Gerrit dashboard; also what a bare gerrit-axi prints

usage: gerrit-axi [dashboard] [options]

The changes awaiting your attention, your work in progress, your outgoing
reviews, the reviews you were asked for and the changes you are CCed on, with a
count per section. Takes no arguments.

options:
  --rows <n>              rows shown per section (default 10, max 100)

usage: gerrit-axi status [mine | <change>... | --query '<query>'] [options]

arguments (at most one form):
  (none)                  changes awaiting your attention ("your turn")
  mine                    your open changes
  <change>...             these change numbers
  --query '<query>'       an arbitrary Gerrit query, as one argument

options:

  --rest-base <u> (see gerrit-axi --help)

examples:
  gerrit-axi status
  gerrit-axi status mine

                          (default 0)
  --comments              also emit the inline comments
  --bots | --humans       with --comments: only / never machine-generated
  --full                  whole message and comment bodies; without it a body
                          over 1000 characters is cut to its first 1000 and its
                          row says chars and truncated: true

global options: --json, --host <h>, --user <u>, --port <p>, --project <p>,
  --rest-base <u> (see gerrit-axi --help)

examples:
  gerrit-axi show 12345
  gerrit-axi show 12345 12346 --messages 3

  comments: `gerrit-axi comments - the inline review comments on every change named

usage: gerrit-axi comments <change>... [options]

arguments:
  <change>...             one or more change numbers (required)

options:
  --bots | --humans       only / never machine-generated (default: both)
  --full                  whole comment bodies; without it a body over 1000
                          characters is cut to its first 1000

  auth: `gerrit-axi auth - whether the stored credential still works

usage: gerrit-axi auth [status]

arguments:
  status                  the only subcommand, and the default. Storing or
                          removing a credential is 'gerrit auth login' and
                          'gerrit auth logout', in the human CLI

Takes no options of its own.

global options: --json, --host <h>, --user <u>, --port <p>, --project <p>,
  --rest-base <u> (see gerrit-axi --help)

examples:
  gerrit-axi auth status
  gerrit-axi auth status --json`,
  publish: `gerrit-axi publish - push the commits on HEAD for review, as changes

usage: gerrit-axi publish --stack --topic <t> [--branch <b>]
       gerrit-axi publish --squash [--branch <b>]

Publishes every commit on HEAD since it left the server's branch. Takes no
arguments; exactly one of --stack or --squash is required.

options:
  --stack                 each commit becomes its own change
  --topic <t>             the topic the stack's changes share (required with
                          --stack, refused with --squash)
  --squash                the commits become one change
  --branch <b>            the branch to propose against (default: the server's
                          default branch)

A Change-Id a commit already carries is pushed verbatim, so a republish is a new
patch set of the same change; a commit without one gets one stamped into its
message and the local branch is rewritten to keep it (messages only).

global options: --json, --host <h>, --user <u>, --port <p>, --project <p>,
  --rest-base <u> (see gerrit-axi --help)

examples:
  gerrit-axi publish --stack --topic retry-backoff
  gerrit-axi publish --squash
  gerrit-axi publish --squash --branch release-2`,
  submit: `gerrit-axi submit - ask the server to submit one change

usage: gerrit-axi submit <change>

arguments:
  <change>                exactly one change number (required); the server
                          submits whatever must go with it

Takes no options of its own. A refusal is reported in the server's own words;
whether a change may be submitted is the server's decision alone.

global options: --json, --host <h>, --user <u>, --port <p>, --project <p>,
  --rest-base <u> (see gerrit-axi --help)

examples:
  gerrit-axi submit 12345
  gerrit-axi submit 12345 --json`,
  message: `gerrit-axi message - post one change-level message on a change's current patch set

usage: gerrit-axi message <change> [--file <path>]

arguments:
  <change>                exactly one change number (required)

options:
  --file <path>           read the text from this file; without it the text is
                          read from stdin. Never from argv

No label, no vote: the record names the patch set the message landed on.

global options: --json, --host <h>, --user <u>, --port <p>, --project <p>,
  --rest-base <u> (see gerrit-axi --help)

examples:
  echo 'Rebased onto the fix; ready for another look.' | gerrit-axi message 12345
  gerrit-axi message 12345 --file reply.txt`,
};
